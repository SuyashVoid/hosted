# Visualizations

- Lavender Visualization: https://cyclonefire.github.io/hosted/NoiseFields/index.html  
   - Going live for Lavender creek farms (https://www.lavendercreekfarm.com/) summer 2023  
   - Will use realtime data (like wind speed, CO2, humidity etc.) sent from the farms to manipulate the visualization
    
- Augmented Reality animated flowers demo : https://cyclonefire.github.io/hosted/XR/flower.html  
   - Runs in A.R supported devices, populating the environment with beautiful customizable 3d flowers.   
   - Created as a test for Microsoft Holo Lens 2     

- Personal Project visualization: https://cyclonefire.github.io/hosted/StarsOfFate/index.html  
   - Edited the visualization to work with mouse for demonstration purposes.   
   - A visualization of colorful stars that connect to each other and interact with other users as you move through them.  
   - Originally designed to work alongside the pairing handheld device (with gyro and accelerometer) that sent their position to the site using MQTT.  
   - Each device had its own colored trail that would interact or light up if moved in a certain pattern within the canvas.
