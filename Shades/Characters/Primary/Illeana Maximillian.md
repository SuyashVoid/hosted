### First Appearance
[[Chapter 6 Perception]]

## Backstory
-  She's actually the **first and only** daughter of Augustus Maximillian the TimeWeaver. Augustus had his daughter with his first wife in the middle years of his long life about 141 years ago.
  
### First Cycle
- She was a genius unlike anything and her understanding of observation was broken beyond measure.
        - In no time, she climbed the ladder and was at the precipice of her Visionary ascension.
        - However her ascension changed her. Everything about her. Her very personality began morphing and she felt it slipping.
        - The path she had chosen, was wrong and she had caused some disaster that had made her hell bent on killing herself. #Incomplete 
        - The trauma was immense and her suicidal frenzy was getting too much for Augustus to control.
        - In her rare moments of lucidity, she begged him to help her.
        - This went on for many years.
- To cure his daughter of that experience that broke her forever leaving her in a suicidal frenzy, he stole the sensation of 'wanting to die' from her.
- She can not intentionally 'want' to kill herself no mater what. Her thought negation comes from highest order of Visionary (Augustus' colleague).
	- After regaining her lucidity to certain extent, she realized the only way to move forward was to give up her viewpoint and do it all over again.
	- Augustus agreed to follow through and used [[Chronoflux Inversion]].
### Second Cycle
- Her next life Cycle She started on a different path and once again progressed like crazy.
	- It was her wish to Augustus to let her find a different path next time and not bar her from the wonders of life or she would be depressed from not having seen the beauty of it.
- The youngest she could get was 12 without damaging her psyche eternally.
- She became 'second' daughter of Monarch Augustus (after 40+ years) and followed a new viewpoint this time
	- This time, Augustus kept a close eye on her progression and tried to do the most he could to not have her be psychologically traumatized.
	- This led to another mess (think abt it later)
	- Augustus had to turn her back again.
### Third Cycle (Current)
-  This time he decided not to let her interact with viewpoint and pass her life as a mortal to death.
	- It wasn't meant to be. The unlight arrived at a very short notice. So as the dictator/forced monarch with no one else trustworthy, he had to teach her of the viewpoint again, but decided to make her the observer of beginning and end with infinite potential for her path.
	- He wanted her to survive this by herself as supporting her too much in her first lives had done her nothing but harm.
	- So he gave her the information needed and she knew beforehand what to do once the unlight came.
	- But the exact timing of unlight's arrival wasn't known yet she didn't hide even knowing full well that Father would leave, and hence the events of [[Chapter 7 Illeana - Soul Seer]].

### Weird Point
- Life extension comes to Observers naturally if they can survive and stabilize the ever-increasing entropy of their own body. For Illeana after [[Chronoflux Inversion]], it was handled by Ethos of one Visionaries of dawn stored in Cenes of iluvium
