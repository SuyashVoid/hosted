### Odd one
- A character that is psycho. He knows his flaws and how to fix them but pretends to go through Phases for the sake of it.
- Eg. He is supposed to be in a despairing situation and knows that staying dull isn't the option but
- Instead of getting his shit together in a direct manner, he acts out the suicide scenario to convince himself.
- Goes through all the motion and pretends to follow through purely to be seen by others (and himself)
- Not for the sake of research or anything noble, just acting out his fantasies and escaping within.
- This could give him that subtle discrepant identity. A loose screw at such a dark level that he himself is lost in its pleasure.
