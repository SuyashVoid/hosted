## Backstory

## Personality

## Events

1.  In free representation, she could see the whole planet and who was crazily consuming light as in new observers. Idea is to limit the knowledge and 'Highest order' Observers to minimum, killing them before they had a chance to form a proper viewpoint.
2.  I can show her viewpoint as Omniscience with her light. She can rearrange light around her to show her anything in her radius (her highest order ability).
	a.  Problem comes from the fact that concept of light's stolen to a great degree by the invading god.
	b.  So even though she could've essentially been omniscient in free-representation, she's having a hard time.
	c.  Her range is whole planet but her acumen is reduced significantly.
4.  First of all, the amount of new observers or survivor of Darkness are MINISCULE already, on top of that she's coordinating the effort with a few other visionaries to wipe out new observers,
5.  New Observers and specially those of such high ascension orders can shake up Observer Society too much and hence they decided to nip em all in bud.

	a.  Controlled, factioned observers have been the staple

	b.  Knowledge of Ascension and any other process is a highly controlled information that is wiped out by those not willing to take chances.
